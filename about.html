<p>I spent the first seventeen years of my life in the dirt: Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar. Following my 
undergraduate degree where I majored in Computer Science and Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, I am now 
completing my Masters of Analytics at the University of San Francisco while working as a Data Scientist at Capital One Labs.</p>
